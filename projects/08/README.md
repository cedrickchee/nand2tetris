# Virtual Machine II - Program Control

We continue building the VM translator. This is a respectable chunk of
engineering, so we are doing it in two stages.

Project 8 extends the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale
VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack
arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle
the VM language's branching and function calling commands.
